    Hey, it looks like you're an admin. Here are some things you can do:
    %div.alert-actions
      %a.btn{:href => admin_tournament_load_default_events_path(@current_tournament) } Import #{@current_tournament.date.year} Events
%p
  To create a bunch of events in the
  %b=@current_tournament.humanize
  tournament, paste in the following text area a series of rows with the following
  %b tab separated columns:
%dl
  %dt Event Name
  %dd The name of the event.
  %dt Division
  %dd Currently, divisions "B" and "C" are supported.
  %dt Room
  %dt Event Start Time
  %dd Beginning of the event; formatted like "9:00:00" for 9:00am or "13:30:00" for 1:30pm.
  %dt Event End Time
  %dd End of the event; formatted like "9:50:00" for 9:50am or "14:20:00" for 2:20pm.
  %dt Number of Timeslots
  %dd
    Number of timeslots to space evenly between the start time and the end time. If the number of timeslots for
    an event is 0, then online registration is disabled for that event.
  %dt Teams per Timeslot
  %dd If number of timeslots is 0, then this setting has no effect.
%p
  If you are about to make a spreadsheet with these values, here is a template you can use and then copy-paste.
